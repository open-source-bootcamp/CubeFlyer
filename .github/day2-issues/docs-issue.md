One of the most needed parts of open source projects is documentation. Many developers will want to work on code, but few want to work on docs. This is a shame, as docs are the most important part of an open source project for a new person to start using it. You can have the most perfect library, but it is useless if no-one knows how to use it.

The CubeFlyer project is lacking in good documentation.

As a **documentation** team, you have been tasked with actually creating documentation. This includes:

* A markdown file with a guide to running the project locally
* Documentation on the structure of the code, also as a markdown file
* Documentation for the features being added by other teams

This documentation should all be in markdown. To add documentation for features being added by other teams, you will need to collaborate with those teams to generate the documentation in tandem. This will be good learning for the other teams to help cement the idea that documentation is a continuous process that includes everyone.

To help you learn markdown syntax, you should work through the [Communicate using Markdown lab on GitHub skills](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown).

VS Code has great support for markdown built in, and its markdown functionality can be improved using a number of extensions. You can learn more in the [markdown in VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown).
